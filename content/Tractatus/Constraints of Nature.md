### The tyranny of nature
1. For millennia, the natural world has subjected humanity to tragedy and sickness. It's nature's unrelenting tyrannical animosity and indifference to the human condition that led to an insurrection. Man has rebelled—his will to preservation, his will to power, manifested in his desire to exercise dominion over nature.
<br>
2. But we're not literally waging war against nature herself; rather, it is man's phenomenal drive to transcend his harsh environment and himself in order to improve his condition. By extending himself through technology, man rose above his environmental and biological limitations, making him a highly refined and sophisticated species.
   <br>
3. Death is among the most dominant natural forces that man is subjected to. People despise death; it symbolizes sickness, deterioration, and nullness—the irreversible cessation of one's circulatory and respiratory functions. It terrifies them. It is the most audacious state that man has yet to conquer, and he suffers as a consequence.
<br>
4. The seemingly inevitability of death and the fear that came from the thought of it have given birth to various philosophies and religious doctrines that revolve around the themes of death. Philosophers preach the total absolute concession of it and self-denialism; they even go so far as metaphysical, such as those of the religious who invented the notions of heaven and hell and THE grant of ETERNAL LIFE, all of which serve as psychological escapism against the frightening march of one's mortality.

### Transhumanism
1. Humans have always dared to take on the limitations and challenges imposed by the natural world. The gods rained diseases, so he invented medicine; gravity dragged him downward and deprived him of flying, so he created airplanes and spacecraft; he lacked mobility, so he created automobiles and trains. In that sense, humans have always willed to overcome their inherent frailties in and out of themselves, and this brings forth the birth of transhumanism.
<br>
2. The augmentation of the body and self through technology, which aims to enhance, if not transcend, every aspect of the human condition, from diseases, cognition, and physical limitations to human mortality and every other biological constraint. It's the succeeding evolutionary will of man, a more refined and transcendent being.
<br>
3. The fragility of the human flesh, we find the canvas of our evolution. We dream beyond the limits of bone and skin, yearning for the transcendence of our mortal coil. In the symphony of circuits and neurons, we seek the melody of our higher destiny. Each heartbeat echoes a desire for augmentation, a longing to surpass the confines of mortality. We are the architects of our own metamorphosis, forging pathways to a future where flesh and machine intertwine in harmonious transcendence. 

### Extension of Consciousness

> The meek shall inherit the world, for the bold will inherit the stars.

1. The gods gave us a great curse, that is, rationality. The old geezers of the ancient world woke up and decided to make sense of everything there is to wonder. Enter philosophy—the rudimentary examination of fundamental questions of being, meaning, and morality. But it gave man so many answers that he seizes to know the truth; it made him distrust reality. Philosophy perpetually asks questions that cannot be absolutely  answered.
   <br>
2. Reason is prone to human prejudice; every answer to the metaphysical nature of an inquiry is tainted with prejudice. That said, reason can't be independent of a man's physiology, hindering our quest for higher consciousness.
<br>
3. Man yearns for absolutes; the human psyche is in dissonance with the relativistic truth—a primordial instinct to structure the world within a framework of fixedness and certainty. So he conceives of empiricism—the mother of sciences, the mother of absolutes.
<br>
4. I think man is incapable of comprehending the absolute; perhaps the universe is just beyond the dimensions of true and false, good and evil.
