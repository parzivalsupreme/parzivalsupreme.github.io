### The tyranny of nature
1. For millennia, the natural world has subjected humanity to tragedy and sickness. It's nature's unrelenting tyrannical animosity and indifference to the human condition that led to an insurrection. Man has rebelled—his will to preservation, his will to power, manifested in his desire to exercise dominion over nature.

2. But we're not literally waging war against nature herself; rather, it is man's phenomenal drive to transcend his harsh environment and himself in order to improve his condition. By extending himself through technology, man rose above his environmental and biological limitations, making him a highly refined and sophisticated species.

3. Death is among the most dominant natural forces that man is subjected to. People despise death; it represents sickness, deterioration, and nullness—the irreversible cessation of one's circulatory and respiratory functions. It terrifies them. It is the most audacious state that man has yet to conquer, and he suffers as a consequence.
<br>
4. The seemingly inevitability of death and the fear that came from the thought of it have given birth to various philosophies and religions that revolve around the themes of death. Philosophers preach the total absolute concession of it and self-denialism; they go beyond the metaphysical, such as those of the religious who invented the notions of heaven and hell and THE grant of ETERNAL LIFE, all of which are psychological escapism for the frightening march of one's mortality.
