A **superintelligence** is a hypothetical [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent "Intelligent agent") that possesses [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence "Intelligence") surpassing that of the [brightest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius "Genius") and most [gifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_giftedness "Intellectual giftedness") human minds. "Superintelligence" may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act in the world. A superintelligence may or may not be created by an [intelligence explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion "Technological singularity") and associated with a [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity "Technological singularity").

[University of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford") philosopher [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom "Nick Bostrom") defines _superintelligence_ as "any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBostrom2014Chapter_2-1) The program [Fritz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_(chess) "Fritz (chess)") falls short of this conception of superintelligence—even though it is much better than humans at chess—because Fritz cannot outperform humans in other tasks.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBostrom201422-2)

Technological researchers disagree about how likely present-day [human intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence "Human intelligence") is to be surpassed. Some argue that advances in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology to achieve radically greater intelligence.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#cite_note-4) Several [future study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_studies "Futures studies") scenarios combine elements from both of these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to [interface with computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface), or [upload their minds to computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading "Mind uploading"), in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification.

### Artificial general intelligence (AGI)
**Artificial general intelligence** (**AGI**) is a theoretical type of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") (AI) that falls within the lower and upper limits of human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-3) This contrasts with [narrow AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_AI "Narrow AI"), which is limited to specific tasks.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-4) [Artificial superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_superintelligence "Artificial superintelligence") (ASI), refers to types of intelligence that range from being only marginally smarter than the upper limits of human intelligence to greatly exceeding human cognitive capabilities by orders of magnitude. AGI is considered one of the definitions of [strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI_(disambiguation) "Strong AI (disambiguation)").

AGI intelligence may be comparable to, match, differ from, or even appear alien-like relative to human intelligence, encompassing a spectrum of possible cognitive architectures and capabilities that includes the spectrum of human-level intelligence.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-5)

Creating AGI is a primary goal of AI research and of companies such as [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:1-6) and [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms "Meta Platforms").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-7) A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI [R&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%26D "R&D") projects spread across 37 countries.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-baum-8)

### Artificial superintelligence (ASI)
Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a software-based system with intellectual powers beyond those of humans across a comprehensive range of categories and fields of endeavor. ASI doesn't exist yet and is a hypothetical state of AI.

ASI is different from regular artificial intelligence ([AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence)), which involves the software-based simulation of human intellectual capabilities, such as learning through the acquisition of information, reasoning and self-correction. AI is increasingly a part of our everyday lives in systems such as [virtual assistants](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/virtual-assistant-AI-assistant), [expert systems](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/expert-system) and [self-driving cars](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/driverless-car). Nevertheless, AI technology is in its early days of development. Systems vary in their abilities, but all current ones are examples of [narrow AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/narrow-AI-weak-AI) or weak AI. They are high-functioning systems that replicate and even surpass human intelligence but only for a specific purpose.

ASI is also known as super AI or superintelligent AI. Theoretically, ASI's superior capabilities would apply across many disciplines and industries and include cognition, general intelligence, problem-solving abilities, social skills and creativity.
