**Darwinism**, theory of the [evolutionary](https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory) mechanism propounded by [Charles Darwin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin) as an explanation of organic change. It denotes Darwin’s specific view that [evolution](https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory) is driven mainly by [natural selection](https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-selection).

### Social Darwinism
**social Darwinism**, the theory that human groups and races are subject to the same laws of [natural selection](https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-selection) as [Charles Darwin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin) perceived in [plants](https://www.britannica.com/plant/plant) and [animals](https://www.britannica.com/animal/animal) in nature. According to the theory, which was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the weak were diminished and their [cultures](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultures) delimited while the strong grew in power and cultural influence over the weak. Social Darwinists held that the life of humans in society was a struggle for existence ruled by “[survival of the fittest](https://www.britannica.com/science/survival-of-the-fittest),” a phrase proposed by the British philosopher and scientist [Herbert Spencer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herbert-Spencer).
