**Cogito, ergo sum**, (Latin: “I think, therefore I am) dictum coined by the French mathematician and philosopher [René Descartes](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rene-Descartes) in his _[Discourse on Method](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Discourse-on-Method)_ (1637) as a first step in demonstrating the attainability of certain knowledge. It is the only statement to survive the test of his [methodic doubt](https://www.britannica.com/topic/methodic-doubt). The statement is [indubitable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indubitable), as Descartes argued in the second of his six [_Meditations on First Philosophy_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Meditations-on-First-Philosophy) (1641), because even if an all-powerful demon were to try to deceive him into [thinking](https://www.britannica.com/topic/thought) that he exists when he does not, he would have to exist in order for the demon to deceive him. Therefore, whenever he thinks, he exists. Furthermore, as he argued in his replies to critics in the second edition (1642) of the _Meditations_, the statement “I am” (_sum_) expresses an immediate [intuition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intuition), not the conclusion of a piece of reasoning (regarding the steps of which he could be deceived), and is thus indubitable. However, in a later work, the _[Principles of Philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Principles-of-Philosophy)_ (1644), Descartes suggested that the cogito is indeed the conclusion of a [syllogism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/syllogism) whose [premises](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premises) include the propositions that he is thinking and that whatever thinks must exist.
