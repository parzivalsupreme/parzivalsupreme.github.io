**Objectivism**, philosophical system identified with the thought of the 20th-century Russian-born American writer [Ayn Rand](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ayn-Rand) and popularized mainly through her commercially successful novels _The Fountainhead_ (1943) and _Atlas Shrugged_ (1957). Its principal [doctrines](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/doctrines) consist of versions of [metaphysical](https://www.britannica.com/topic/metaphysical-realism) [realism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/realism-philosophy) (the [existence](https://www.britannica.com/topic/existence) and nature of things in the world are independent of their being perceived or thought about), epistemological (or [direct](https://www.britannica.com/topic/direct-realism)) realism (things in the world are perceived immediately or directly rather than inferred on the basis of perceptual evidence), [ethical egoism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethics-philosophy/Natural-law-ethics#ref252577) (an action is morally right if it promotes the self-interest of the agent), [individualism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/individualism) (a [political system](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-system) is just if it properly respects the rights and interests of the individual), and [laissez-faire](https://www.britannica.com/topic/laissez-faire) [capitalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/capitalism). Objectivism also addresses issues in [aesthetics](https://www.britannica.com/topic/aesthetics) and the [philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy) of love and sex. Perhaps the best-known and most-controversial aspect of objectivism is its account of the [moral](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral) virtues, in particular its unconventional claim that selfishness is a [virtue](https://www.britannica.com/topic/virtue-in-Christianity) and [altruism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/altruism-ethics) a vice.

Rand held that all people, whether they realize it or not, are guided in their thoughts and actions by philosophical principles and assumptions. Philosophy thus has great practical import, and indeed possessing the correct philosophy is essential to leading a successful and happy life. The branches of philosophy that most directly affect everyday life are [ethics](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethics-philosophy) and [political philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-philosophy)
