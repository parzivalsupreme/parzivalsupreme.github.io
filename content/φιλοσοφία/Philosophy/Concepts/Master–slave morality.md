**Master–slave morality** ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): _Herren- und Sklavenmoral_) is a central theme of [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "Friedrich Nietzsche")'s works, particularly in the first essay of his book _[On the Genealogy of Morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Genealogy_of_Morality "On the Genealogy of Morality")_.

Nietzsche argues that there are two fundamental types of [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality "Morality"): "master morality" and "slave morality", which correspond, respectively, to the dichotomies of "good/bad" and "good/evil". In master morality, "good" is a self-designation of the aristocratic classes; it is synonymous with nobility and everything powerful and life-affirming. "Bad" has no condemnatory implication, merely referring to the "common" or the "low" and the qualities and values associated with them, in contradistinction to the warrior ethos of the ruling nobility. In slave morality, the meaning of "good" is made the antithesis of the original aristocratic "good", which itself is relabeled "evil". This inversion of values develops out of the _[ressentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment "Ressentiment")_ the weak feel toward the powerful.

For Nietzsche, a morality is inseparable from the culture that values it, meaning that each culture's language, codes, practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures.
