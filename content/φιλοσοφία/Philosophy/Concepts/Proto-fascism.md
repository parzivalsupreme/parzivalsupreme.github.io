**Protofascism**, a political movement that predates and usually contributes to the emergence of [fascism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism) in a given country, sometimes by evolving into a fascist movement itself. The term _protofascism_ is also used in a slightly more general sense to refer to any political movement whose activities make the emergence of [fascism](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/fascism) more likely. By definition, protofascist movements display some of the common characteristics of fascism—such as the scapegoating of ethnic or religious minorities, the glorification of violence, and the promotion of the _Führerprinzip_ (“leadership principle”), the belief that the party and the state should have a single leader with absolute power—but usually do not share its radicalism or totalitarian ambitions. In another related usage, _protofascism_ has been applied to contemporary (post-[World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II)) political movements and parties that are not clearly fascist or [neofascist](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Neofascism#ref219394) but which resemble historical fascist movements and regimes in certain respects. _Protofascist_ in this sense is sometimes used interchangeably with _semifascist_, _quasifascist_, and _borderline fascist_. Contemporary fascist or neofascist movements that attempt to conceal or misrepresent their [ideologies](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ideologies) are sometimes referred to as “cryptofascist.”
