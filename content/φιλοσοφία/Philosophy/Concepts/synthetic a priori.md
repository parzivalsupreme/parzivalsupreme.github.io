**Synthetic a priori proposition**, in [logic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/logic), a proposition the [predicate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predicate) of which is not logically or analytically contained in the subject—i.e., synthetic—and the [truth](https://www.britannica.com/topic/truth-philosophy-and-logic) of which is verifiable independently of experience—i.e., a priori. Thus the proposition “Some bodies are heavy” is [synthetic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/synthetic) because the idea of heaviness is not necessarily contained in that of bodies. On the other hand, the proposition “All husbands are male” is [analytic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analytic) because the idea of maleness is already contained in that of husband. In general the truth or [falsity](https://www.britannica.com/topic/falsity) of synthetic statements is proved only by whether or not they conform to the way the world is and not by virtue of the meaning of the words they contain. Synthetic [a priori knowledge](https://www.britannica.com/topic/a-priori-knowledge) is central to the thought of [Immanuel Kant](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant), who argued that some such a priori concepts are presupposed by the very [possibility](https://www.britannica.com/topic/possibility) of experience.
