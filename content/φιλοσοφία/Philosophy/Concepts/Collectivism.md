**Collectivism**, any of several types of social organization in which the individual is seen as being subordinate to a social collectivity such as a state, a nation, a race, or a [social class](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-class). Collectivism may be contrasted with [individualism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/individualism) (_q.v._), in which the rights and interests of the individual are emphasized.

The earliest modern, influential expression of collectivist ideas in the West is in [Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Jacques-Rousseau) _Du contrat social,_ of 1762 (_see_ [social contract](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-contract)), in which it is argued that the individual finds his true being and freedom only in submission to the “general will” of the [community](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community). In the early 19th century the German philosopher G.W.F. [](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-Wilhelm-Friedrich-Hegel)Hegel argued that the individual realizes his true being and freedom only in unqualified submission to the laws and institutions of the nation-state, which to Hegel was the highest embodiment of social [morality](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/morality). [Karl Marx](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Marx) later provided the most [succinct](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/succinct) statement of the collectivist view of the primacy of social interaction in the preface to his _[Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy:](https://www.britannica.com/topic/A-Contribution-to-the-Critique-of-Political-Economy)_ “It is not men’s consciousness,” he wrote, “which determines their being, but their social being which determines their consciousness.”

Collectivism has found varying degrees of expression in the 20th century in such movements as [socialism](https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/socialism), [communism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism), and [fascism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism). The least collectivist of these is [social democracy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-democracy), which seeks to reduce the inequities of unrestrained capitalism by government regulation, redistribution of income, and varying degrees of planning and [public ownership](https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/public-enterprise). In [](https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism)communist systems collectivism is carried to its furthest extreme, with a minimum of private ownership and a maximum of [planned economy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/command-economy).
