**Lamarckism**, a theory of [evolution](https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory) based on the principle that physical changes in organisms during their lifetime—such as greater development of an [organ](https://www.britannica.com/science/organ-biology) or a part through increased use—could be transmitted to their offspring. The doctrine, proposed by the French naturalist [Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Baptiste-Lamarck) in 1809, influenced evolutionary thought through most of the 19th century. Lamarckism was discredited by most geneticists after the 1930s, but certain of its ideas continued to be held in the [Soviet Union](https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union) into the mid-20th century.
