**Epistemology**, the philosophical study of the nature, origin, and limits of human [knowledge](https://www.britannica.com/topic/knowledge). The term is derived from the Greek _epistēmē_ (“knowledge”) and _logos_ (“reason”), and accordingly the field is sometimes referred to as the theory of knowledge. Epistemology has a long history within [Western philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy), beginning with the ancient Greeks and continuing to the present. Along with [metaphysics](https://www.britannica.com/topic/metaphysics), [logic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/logic), and [ethics](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethics-philosophy), it is one of the four main branches of [philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy), and nearly every great philosopher has contributed to it.
