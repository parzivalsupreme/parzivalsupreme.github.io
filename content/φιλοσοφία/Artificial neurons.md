An **artificial neuron** is a [mathematical function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") conceived as a [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") of biological [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") in a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network "Neural network"). Artificial neurons are the elementary units of [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron#cite_note-1) The artificial neuron is a function that receives one or more inputs, applies weights to these inputs, and sums them to produce an output.

The design of the artificial neuron was inspired by [neural circuitry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuitry "Neural circuitry"). Its inputs are analogous to [excitatory postsynaptic potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential "Excitatory postsynaptic potential") and [inhibitory postsynaptic potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential "Inhibitory postsynaptic potential") at neural [dendrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite "Dendrite"), or activation, its weights are analogous to [synaptic weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_weight "Synaptic weight"), and its output is analogous to a neuron's [action potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential "Action potential") which is transmitted along its [axon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon "Axon").

Usually, each input is separately [weighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting "Weighting"), and the sum is often added to a term known as a _bias_ (loosely corresponding to the [threshold potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_potential "Threshold potential")), before being passed through a [non-linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_function "Non-linear function") known as an [activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function "Activation function") or [transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function "Transfer function")[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]. The transfer functions usually have a [sigmoid shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function "Sigmoid function"), but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, [piecewise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise "Piecewise") linear functions, or [step functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron#Step_function). They are also often [monotonically increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function "Monotonic function"), [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"), [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") and [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_function "Bounded function"). Non-monotonic, unbounded and oscillating activation functions with multiple zeros that outperform sigmoidal and ReLU-like activation functions on many tasks have also been recently explored. The thresholding function has inspired building [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate "Logic gate") referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building [logic circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_circuit "Logic circuit") resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as [memristors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor "Memristor") have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron#cite_note-2)

The artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system's [transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function "Transfer function").

An artificial neuron may be referred to as a **semi-linear unit**, **Nv neuron**, **binary neuron**, **linear threshold function**, or **McCulloch–Pitts** (**MCP**) **neuron**, depending on the structure used.

Simple artificial neurons, such as the McCulloch–Pitts model, are sometimes described as "caricature models", since they are intended to reflect one or more neurophysiological observations, but without regard to realism.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron#cite_note-3) Artificial neurons can also refer to [artificial cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cell "Artificial cell") in [neuromorphic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering "Neuromorphic engineering") (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron#Physical_artificial_cells)) that are similar to natural physical neurons.
