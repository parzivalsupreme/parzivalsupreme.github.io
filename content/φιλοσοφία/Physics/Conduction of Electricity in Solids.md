Metals, Semiconductors, and Insulators Three electrical properties that can be used to distinguish among crystalline solids are resistivity r, temperature coefficient of resistivity a, and number density of charge carriers n. Solids can be broadly divided into insulators (very high r), metals (low r, positive and low a, large n), and semiconductors (high r, negative and high a, small n). Energy Levels and Gaps in a Crystalline Solid An isolated atom can exist in only a discrete set of energy levels. As atoms come together to form a solid, the levels of the individual atoms merge to form the discrete energy bands of the solid. These energy bands are separated by energy gaps, each of which corresponds to a range of energies that no electron may possess. Any energy band is made up of an enormous number of very closely spaced levels.The Pauli exclusion principle asserts that only one electron may occupy each of these levels. Insulators In an insulator, the highest band containing electrons is completely filled and is separated from the vacant band above it by an energy gap so large that electrons can essentially never become thermally agitated enough to jump across the gap. Metals In a metal, the highest band that contains any electrons is only partially filled. The energy of the highest filled level at a temperature of 0 K is called the Fermi energy EF for the metal. The electrons in the partially filled band are the conduction electrons and their number is

$$
N_e \text{ for the number of conduction electrons in the sample.}
$$

$$
N_a \text{ for the number of atoms in the sample.}
$$

$$
N_v \text{ for the number of valence electrons per atom.}
$$

$$
N_e = N_a \cdot N_v
$$

The number of atoms in a sample is given by
$$
\text{(number of atoms in sample)} = \frac{\text{sample mass } M_{\text{sam}}}{\text{atomic mass}} = \frac{\text{sample mass } M_{\text{sam}}}{\frac{\text{molar mass } M}{N_A}} = \frac{\text{material’s density} \times \text{sample volume } V}{\frac{\text{molar mass } M}{N_A}}
$$

The number density n of the conduction electrons is
$$
n = \frac{\text{number of conduction electrons in sample}}{\text{sample volume } V}
$$

The density of states function N(E) is the number of available energy levels per unit volume of the sample and per unit energy interval and is given by
$$
N(E) = \frac{8\sqrt{2} \pi m^{3/2}}{h^3} E^{1/2} \quad \text{density of states: } m^{-3} \, J^{-1}
$$
$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{Where } m = 9.109 \times 10^{31} \text{ kg is the electron mass,} \\
& h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s is the Planck constant, and} \\
& N(E) \text{ is the energy in joules at which } N(E) \text{ is to be evaluated.}
\end{align*}
$$

To modify the equation so that the value of $E$ is in $eV$ and the value of $N(E)$ is in $m^{-3} eV^{-1}$ , multiply the right side by $e^{3/2}$ (where $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \quad C$).

The occupancy probability P(E), the probability that a given available state will be occupied by an electron, is
$$
P(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E - E_F)/kT}} + 1 \quad (\text{occupancy probability})
$$

The density of occupied states No(E) is given by the product of the two quantities: 
$$
