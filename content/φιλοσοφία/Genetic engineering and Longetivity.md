**Genetic engineering**, the artificial manipulation, modification, and recombination of [DNA](https://www.britannica.com/science/DNA) or other [nucleic acid](https://www.britannica.com/science/nucleic-acid) [molecules](https://www.britannica.com/science/molecule) in order to modify an [organism](https://www.britannica.com/science/multicellular-organism) or [population](https://www.britannica.com/science/population-biology-and-anthropology) of organisms. The term _genetic engineering_ is generally used to refer to methods of [recombinant DNA technology](https://www.britannica.com/science/recombinant-DNA-technology), which emerged from basic research in microbial [genetics](https://www.britannica.com/science/genetics). The techniques employed in genetic [engineering](https://www.britannica.com/technology/engineering) have led to the production of medically important products, including human [insulin](https://www.britannica.com/science/insulin), human [growth hormone](https://www.britannica.com/science/growth-hormone), and [hepatitis B](https://www.britannica.com/science/hepatitis-B) [vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine), as well as to the development of [genetically modified organisms](https://www.britannica.com/science/genetically-modified-organism) such as disease-resistant plants.

Longevity refer to the state of living beyond the average life expectancy. This can include the ability to survive beyond the species-specific average age of death.

### Genome editing

Genome editing is a method for making specific changes to the DNA of a cell or organism. It can be used to add, remove or alter DNA in the genome. Human genome editing technologies can be used on somatic cells (non-heritable), germline cells (not for reproduction) and germline cells (for reproduction).  

Application of somatic human genome editing has already been undertaken, including in vivo editing, to address HIV and sickle-cell disease, for example. Although somatic human genome editing is well established and acceptable for treatments in some scientifically advanced countries with regulations in place, challenges remain. These include the need to develop inclusive genome editing innovations that take note of the diversity of the human population and human experience. Other challenges are associated with rogue clinics, medical travel, as well as the reporting of illegal, unregistered, unethical or unsafe research and other activities including the offer of unproven so-called therapeutic interventions.  

Heritable human genome editing refers to editing of nuclear DNA in a way that may be heritable across generations. Heritable human genome editing is the subject of intense debate over its possible consequences for offspring and for society in general. They may pose greater safety and ethical issues than somatic human genome editing.

## Human cloning

**Human cloning** is the creation of a genetically [identical copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning "Cloning") of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human [cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning "Cloning"), which is the reproduction of human [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") and [tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology) "Tissue (biology)"). It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [identical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monozygotic "Monozygotic") [twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth "Multiple birth"). The possibilities of human cloning [have raised controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_cloning "Ethics of cloning"). These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass laws regarding human cloning.

Two commonly discussed types of human cloning are _therapeutic cloning_ and _reproductive cloning_.

Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants. It is an active area of research, and is in medical practice in the world. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [somatic-cell nuclear transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic-cell_nuclear_transfer "Somatic-cell nuclear transfer") and (more recently) [pluripotent stem cell induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell "Induced pluripotent stem cell").

Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.

## Mind upload
**Mind uploading** is a speculative process of **whole brain emulation** in which a [brain scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_scanning "Brain scanning") is used to completely [emulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator "Emulator") the mental state of the individual in a [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data "Digital data") [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"). The computer would then run a [simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation "Computer simulation") of the brain's information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a [sentient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient "Sentient") [conscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscious "Conscious") [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-sim.me.uk-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-kajsotala.fi-3)

Substantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience "Neuroscience") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), including animal brain mapping and simulation,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-ReferenceA-4) development of faster supercomputers, [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality "Virtual reality"), [brain–computer interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface "Brain–computer interface"), [connectomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectomics "Connectomics"), and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-5) According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.

Mind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons "Neurons") (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original [organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_matter "Organic matter") brain no longer exists and a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") emulating the brain takes control over the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and [mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_mapping "Brain mapping") the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological "Biological") brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or [simulated world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality "Simulated reality"), supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside—or either connected to or remotely controlled by—a (not necessarily [humanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid "Humanoid")) [robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot "Robot"), biological, or [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg "Cyborg") body.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-Roadmap-6)

Among some [futurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist "Futurist") and within the part of [transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism "Transhumanism") movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed [life extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension "Life extension") or [immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality "Immortality") technology (known as "[digital immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_immortality "Digital immortality")"). Some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to [cryonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics "Cryonics"). Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our "mind-file", to enable interstellar space travel, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole-brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a "logical endpoint"[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-Roadmap-6) of the topical [computational neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience "Computational neuroscience") and [neuroinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroinformatics "Neuroinformatics") fields, both about [brain simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_simulation "Brain simulation") for medical research purposes. It is discussed in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") research publications as an approach to [strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_theory_of_mind "Computational theory of mind") ([artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence")) and to at least weak [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence "Superintelligence"). Another approach is [seed AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_AI "Seed AI"), which would not be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity "Technological singularity"), meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-7) Mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of [numerous science fiction novels, films, and games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading_in_fiction "Mind uploading in fiction").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading#cite_note-8)
