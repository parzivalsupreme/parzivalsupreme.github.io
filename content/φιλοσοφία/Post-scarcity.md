**Post-scarcity** is a theoretical [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic "Economic") situation in which most goods can be produced in great abundance with minimal human labor needed, so that they become available to all very cheaply or even [freely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre "Gratis versus libre").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity#cite_note-2)

Post-scarcity does not mean that [scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity "Scarcity") has been eliminated for all goods and services but that all people can easily have their basic survival needs met along with some significant proportion of their desires for goods and services.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity#cite_note-3) Writers on the topic often emphasize that some commodities will remain scarce in a post-scarcity society.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity#cite_note-fourfuturesarticle-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity#cite_note-7)
