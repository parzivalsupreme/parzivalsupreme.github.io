**Eugenics**, the selection of desired heritable [characteristics](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/characteristics) in order to improve future generations, typically in reference to humans. The term _eugenics_ was coined in 1883 by British explorer and natural scientist [Francis Galton](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Francis-Galton), who, influenced by [Charles Darwin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin)’s theory of [natural selection](https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-selection), advocated a system that would allow “the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable.” [Social Darwinism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-Darwinism), the popular theory in the late 19th century that life for humans in society was ruled by “survival of the fittest,” helped advance eugenics into serious scientific study in the early 1900s. By [World War I](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I) many scientific authorities and political leaders supported eugenics. 

### Plato's Republic
[Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s [political philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_political_philosophy "Plato's political philosophy") included the belief that human reproduction should be cautiously monitored and controlled by the state.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_eugenics#cite_note-14) He advocated [selective breeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding "Selective breeding") be applied to both humans and animals. Plato recognized that this form of government control would not be readily accepted, and proposed the truth be concealed from the public via a fixed lottery. Mates, in Plato's [_Republic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)#Book_V%E2%80%93VI:_The_Ship_of_State "Republic (Plato)"), would be chosen by a "marriage number" in which the quality of the individual would be quantitatively analyzed, and persons of high numbers would be allowed to procreate with other persons of high numbers. This would then lead to predictable results and the improvement of the human race. Plato acknowledged the failure of the "marriage number" since "gold soul" persons could still produce "bronze soul" children.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_eugenics#cite_note-15) Plato's ideas may have been one of the earliest attempts to mathematically analyze [genetic inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity "Heredity"), prefiguring some of what would much later become known as [Mendelian genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance "Mendelian inheritance").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_eugenics#cite_note-16)
