**Genetic engineering**, the artificial manipulation, modification, and recombination of [DNA](https://www.britannica.com/science/DNA) or other [nucleic acid](https://www.britannica.com/science/nucleic-acid) [molecules](https://www.britannica.com/science/molecule) in order to modify an [organism](https://www.britannica.com/science/multicellular-organism) or [population](https://www.britannica.com/science/population-biology-and-anthropology) of organisms. The term _genetic engineering_ is generally used to refer to methods of [recombinant DNA technology](https://www.britannica.com/science/recombinant-DNA-technology), which emerged from basic research in microbial [genetics](https://www.britannica.com/science/genetics). The techniques employed in genetic [engineering](https://www.britannica.com/technology/engineering) have led to the production of medically important products, including human [insulin](https://www.britannica.com/science/insulin), human [growth hormone](https://www.britannica.com/science/growth-hormone), and [hepatitis B](https://www.britannica.com/science/hepatitis-B) [vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine), as well as to the development of [genetically modified organisms](https://www.britannica.com/science/genetically-modified-organism) such as disease-resistant plants.
