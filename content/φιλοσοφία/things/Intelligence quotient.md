**IQ**, (from “intelligence quotient”), a number used to express the relative intelligence of a person. It is one of many [intelligence tests](https://www.britannica.com/science/intelligence-test).

IQ was originally computed by taking the ratio of [mental age](https://www.britannica.com/science/mental-age) to [chronological](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/chronological) (physical) age and multiplying by 100. Thus, if a 10-year-old child had a mental age of 12 (that is, performed on the test at the level of an average 12-year-old), the child was assigned an IQ of 12/10 × 100, or 120. If the 10-year-old had a mental age of 8, the child’s IQ would be 8/10 × 100, or 80. Based on this calculation, a score of 100—where the mental age equals the chronological age—would be average. Few tests continue to involve the computation of mental ages. _See also_ [Lewis Terman](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lewis-Terman); [Alfred Binet](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Binet).
