**Definition of an Angle**: An angle is the figure formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex.

**Types of Angles**:

- Acute angle: less than 90°
- Right angle: exactly 90°
- Obtuse angle: greater than 90° but less than 180°
- Straight angle: exactly 180°
- Reflex angle: greater than 180° but less than 360°
- Complete angle: exactly 360°

**Arc Length Formula**: The formula to find the length of an arc is: Arc Length = (Central Angle/360) × Circumference of Circle

**Subtended Angle**: The angle formed by two lines or line segments that intersect at a point, with the vertex at the point of intersection.

**Isosceles Triangle**: A triangle with two sides of equal length.

**Parts of a Wave**:

- Period: the time taken by the wave to complete one cycle
- Amplitude: the maximum displacement of the wave from its mean position

**Co-functions**: Trigonometric functions that have a complementary relationship, such as sine and cosine, or tangent and cotangent.

**Word Problem Involving Right Triangles**: Example: A building is 15 meters tall, and the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 60°. How far is the observer from the base of the building?

**SOH CAH TOA**: A mnemonic to remember the trigonometric ratios:

- Sine = Opposite side / Hypotenuse
- Cosine = Adjacent side / Hypotenuse
- Tangent = Opposite side / Adjacent side

**Converting from Degrees to Radians**: 1 radian = (180/π) degrees. To convert, multiply the degree measure by (π/180).

**Bearing Angle**: The direction or angle between a line and a reference direction, usually north.

**Solving Word Problems for Oblique Triangles**: Example: A pilot is flying a plane at an altitude of 10,000 meters, and the angle of depression to a target is 30°. How far is the target from the plane?

**Period of a Function**: The smallest interval of time after which the function repeats its values.

**Supplement and Complement of an Angle**:

- Supplement: the angle formed by adding 180° to a given angle
- Complement: the angle formed by subtracting a given angle from 90°

**Amplitude of a Graph**: The maximum displacement of the graph from its mean position.

**Area of a Triangle**: The formula to find the area of a triangle is: Area = (Base × Height) / 2
