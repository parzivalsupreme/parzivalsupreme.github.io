There are three ways to solve systems of linear equations: substitution, elimination, and graphing.

#### **Substitution**

#### **Graphing**
1. Solve for _y_ in each equation.
2. Graph both equations on the same Cartesian coordinate system.
3. Find the point of intersection point of the lines (the point where the lines cross).
